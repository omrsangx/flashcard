# Flashcard

This is a simple Swedish to English vocabulary flashcard (web app). At the moment, is only Swedish to English, but the end goal is to choose from a handful of languages.

I originally created the flashcard in Python; however, I wanted to recrate the flashcard just using Javascript and simplify tbe process.
Currently, you can use it as it is; however, I consider this project a work in progress since I will be adding more vocabularies and features.
